This report represents the work done in my master's thesis (Master of
Science) in Computer Science at the Department of The Faculty of 
Engineering and Natural Sciences (TNF) at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) 
Linz, Austria. My supervisors have been DI Dr. Professor Windsteiger Wolfgang 
at Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) which is an institute of 
JKU, who has patiently endured questions and provided both encouragement and criticism.
	

Many thanks also to Prof. Dr.Dr.h.c.mult. Buchberger Bruno at RISC, who is the 
head of Softwarepark Hagenberg, for acceptance to ISI-Program, for helps and 
for giving motivation for my future works. Who came up with idea of creating 
proving system Theorema.
