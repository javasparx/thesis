This chapter set out to survey large-scale phylogeny and alignment estimation. 
As we have seen, large-scale alignment and phylogeny estimation 
(whether of species or of individual genes) is a complicated problem. 
Despite the multitude of methods for each step, the estimation of very 
large sequence alignments or gene trees is still quite diffcult, 
and the estimation of species phylogenies (whether trees or networks!), 
even more so. Furthermore, the challenges in large-scale estimation 
are not computational feasibility (running time and memory), as 
inferential methods can differ in their theoretical and empirical 
performance.
